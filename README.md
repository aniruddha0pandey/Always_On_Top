# <div align="center">Always On Top</div>

Hi,<br/>
I'm Aniruddha and I like to mulitask. But I cannot do that in the hubbub of these terrible amount of tabs, switching between muliple windows to find that one particular one is just not my thing. And for a **Windows** user like me things become adverse. Since I use the <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/">GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)<a/> for my C/C++ compilation I'm prone to switch between multiple tabs. As a upshot I hope to have the `Always On Top` feature available in OS like **Linux** to make the anticipated window in front of everything or of the heighest z-value. **Windows** doesnâ€™t offer a built-in way for users to make a window always on top but there's a catch there are many third-party tools availabe for this and I started to probe with a few and end with the three handy software.<br/>
