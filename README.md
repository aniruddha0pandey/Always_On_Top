# <div align="center">Always On Top</div>

Hi,<br/>
I'm Aniruddha and I like to mulitask. But I cannot do that in the hubbub of these terrible amount of tabs, switching between muliple windows to find that one particular one is just not my thing. And for a **Windows** user like me things become adverse. I use the **GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)** for my C/C++ compilation I prone to switch between multiple tabs.
